    <h2>CSS Box Model </h2>
    <p>This means that every element on a web page is like a box, and depending on its default display style, it can be either a block (which takes up the whole width of its container) or inline (which sits alongside other elements horizontally). For example, elements like paragraphs, divs, and sections are block-level, while elements like spans and cites are inline and will sit next to each other horizontally, wrapping onto new lines if needed.
